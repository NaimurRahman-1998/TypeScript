# TypeScript
TypeScript is an Object Oriented Language which is built on top of JavaScript

### to transpile .ts file we use 
```
tsnd --respawn
```
#### TypeScript Extends JavScript

JavaScript is a dynamically typed Language. which means 
an variable can be re-Assigned as much as the user wants

```
var a = 'string';
a=[]
```

#### in JavaScript we write Object Oriented Programming with the help of syntactic sugar But in TypeScript we do not need to dot that


#### Unlike JavaScript , Browser cannot read typeScript file. 
#### for that wee need to transpile Js ->Ts

#### We can specify to which version of Js we want to convert to
